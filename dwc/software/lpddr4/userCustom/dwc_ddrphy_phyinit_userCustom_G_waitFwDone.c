/** \brief Implements the mechanism to wait for completion of training firmware
 * execution.
 *
 * The purpose of user this function is to wait for firmware to finish training.
 * The user can either implement a counter to wait or implement the polling
 * mechanism described in the Training Firmware App Note section "Running the
 * Firmware".  The wait time is highly dependent on the training features
 * enabled via SequenceCtrl input to the message block.  See Training Firmware
 * App note for details. 
 *
 * The default behavior of this function is to print comments relating to this
 * process.  A function call of the same name will be printed in the output text
 * file.
 *
 * The user can choose to leave this function as is, or implement mechanism to
 * trigger mailbox poling event in simulation.

 * \return void
