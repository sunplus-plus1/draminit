 *
 * This is user-editable function.  User can edit this function according to 
 * their needs.
 * 
 * The user must provide and implementation for reading registers from the PHY
 * in this function.  PhyInit calls this function during PHY initialization to
 * read the register content of the PHY for the purpose of restoring the PHY
 * state during retention exit.

 * Implementation of this function is only necessary if PhyInit retention
 * restore sequence feature is used.
 * 
 * For the purpose of generating the output txt file, the below implementation
 * prints a "dwc_ddrphy_apb_rd()" commands to the output for reference. The
 * output text is commented out and 0 is always returned.
 *
 *  \param adr address of register to read
 *  \returns register value
